# zorkClone
This project aims to reimplement the good old nerdy game [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), parts I, II and III in java. 

*This is not a wrapper*, it's a reimplementation with
- A nice command window (no need for any emulator for a 1980s command line)
- Autocomplete
- A list of commands that you can execute in the current game situation

**Note:** This project has just started so nothing works right now and no downloads are offered at this stage.

## Download
As this project just started, we do not offer any downloads yet. Once available, downloads will be offered using the FOKLauncher ([GitHubRepo](https://github.com/vatbub/fokLauncher)|[Download](https://bintray.com/vatbub/fokprojectsReleases/foklauncher#downloads)).

While you are waiting, you might want to try the [original version](https://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html).

## Compile
If you wish to compile the project, just clone the repo and run `mvn package` ([Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) required)

## I am a nerd, I want to contribute
I am glad to know that I am not the only nerd around here so let me know via [eMail](mailto:vatbub123@googlemail.com) and I'll happily add you to the team.
Feel free to [file issues](https://github.com/vatbub/zorkClone/issues/new), fork or submit PRs.

## The roadmap
- create a functioning framework for textbased adventure games (data model, gui, parser)
- Rewrite the story of Zork I, II and III using the framework

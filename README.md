# zorkClone [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vatbub/zorkClone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vatbub/zorkClone)
This project aims to reimplement the good old nerdy game [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), parts I, II and III in java. 

*This is not a wrapper*, it's a reimplementation with
- A nice command window (no need for any emulator for a 1980s command line)
- Autocomplete
- A list of commands that you can execute in the current game situation

**Note:** This project has just started so nothing works right now and no downloads are offered at this stage.

## Download
